Calendar App for Pebble

This is an app for the Pebble Watch.  It shows a month view calendar.

When paired with the Pebble Calendar Android app, it will monitor your phone's calendar and display days with events in Bold.

As an App:

Up Button moves to previous month.
Down Button moves to next month.
Center Button returns to current month.

As a Watchface:

Always shows current month (Watchfaces can not respond to buttons)

The published code will compile as an App.  To change it to compile as a watchface the following changes are required.

Near the top of calendarApp.c change #define WATCHMODE false to true.
In appinfo.json change watchface to true and replace the UUID with the watchface. 


For easy localization, the following arrays defined near the top of calendarApp.c can be modified.

daysOfWeek
        holds the text used for the column headings

months
        holds the text used for the month text displayed at the top of the app.

IMPORTANT, the current version requires Pebble SDKv2.0 and will only run on watches that have been updated to Firmware 2.0 or later.  The last version to compatible with SDK/Firmware 1.x can be found here. https://github.com/WilliamHeaton/PebbleCalendarWatch/tree/7cf62b37c3527fc9ff687615d90afc7a6d88edc6
